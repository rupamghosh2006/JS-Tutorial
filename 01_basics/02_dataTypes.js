/*
This is actually a well-known bug in JavaScript.

null is not an object, but typeof null returns "object" 
due to a legacy bug in the language that dates back to its early implementation.

What is null then?
null is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

Itâ€™s often used to indicate that a variable should later hold an object, but currently does not.
